# CMSE 492 Final Project – Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the probability that an auto-insurance policyholder will file a claim within the next year.  
The analysis explores ensemble-based methods that handle class imbalance, such as **Balanced Random Forest** and **EasyEnsemble**, to improve prediction performance and interpretability.
